## Migration Guide from PHP Version

### Automatic Migration
The Go version automatically migrates data from the existing PHP version:

1. **Users**: User accounts and permissions are imported from JSON files
2. **Centers**: Center configurations are migrated to the database
3. **Materials**: Material inventory is transferred to SQLite
4. **Activities**: Existing activities are imported and preserved
5. **Passwords**: PHP password hashes remain compatible

### Manual Steps
1. **Backup**: Always backup your existing `data/` directory
2. **Deploy**: Deploy the new Go binary or Docker image
3. **Verify**: Check that all data has been migrated correctly
4. **Test**: Test login and functionality with existing users

### Configuration Changes
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration now uses environment variables instead of PHP config files
- **Data Directory**: The `DATA_DIR` environment variable controls data location
- **Port Configuration**: Use `PORT` environment variable instead of Apache configuration
